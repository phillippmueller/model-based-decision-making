# EPA-simmodel
Project Structure
The project repository is organized as follows:

data/: Contains input data files required for the model.

results/: Stores the results obtained from running the model.

plots/: Stores the graphs obtained from running the model.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.
Getting Started
To run the flood risk management model and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the input data:

Ensure the necessary input data files are located in the data/ directory.
Modify the input data files as per your requirements.
Run the model:

Explore the results:

Analyze the generated results stored in the results/ directory.
Utilize the provided Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for data analysis and visualization.
Additional Notes
The project utilizes Python for model implementation and analysis.
The computational model incorporates various factors such as flood wave shape, dike characteristics, investment costs, and evacuation measures.
The results provide insights into the effectiveness of different flood risk management policies.
